None. The dev team interested in building it has been in the crypto sphere for so long now.

Why are you interested in working on the project?
There is a big industry in control of a few, which is the betting industry. It is a fully centralised world, where users' wealth is being absorbed. With that project, self-sustainability is reached through pools and staking, and people losses are redistributed among those using the platform. Moreover, it creates synergies due to the need of strong Oracles such as that would provide the external data required for those bets, and would engage the community on developing and searching for new categories, on which to bet. Moreover, it would become a generator of liquidity for where the blockchain is built.
I would like to decentralise an inustry such centralised as the betting one. As the crypto ecosystem is increasingly growing, so it is the financial industry being built in it. The project is not seeking for large gains, and this is why it is different. In a betting platform, you can rather win or lose. In this project, you can win, but when you lose you also win, as most of the money made from losses (which would be the profits of a standard betting corp) is accumulated in a pool that will eventually redistribute it between those gambling and those staking the token that powers the liquidity pools.

How long will you need to build the project?
There is no timeline.

Project implementation?
Once the initial funding issue is solved, a developers team will write the code needed for running the project. Legal issues will become one of the main focuses.
